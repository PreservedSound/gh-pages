Now, living between Nuuk and Krakow, GBTP bring you their very own form of ambient intergalactic indie rock.<br><br>The debut eponymous album by Grace Beneath the Pines takes influences from the raw, methodical emotion of bands such as Codeine, The For Carnation and Slint, fused with the lyrical lightness of Low and Piano Magic. Written with three different formations using three different bass players, each adding their own personality, skill, love and passion to the writing process, <em>Grace Beneath the Pines</em> is a musical journey that takes the listener to different places (musically speaking) through an amalgamation of musical styles and rhythms.</p>",

Using piano and electronics, “Snow” is full of textures, clocking in at over ten minutes, and sets up the rest of the EP beautifully. A fast, staccato piano line slowly builds, with piano chords and electronics, falling into ambient noise; only for the piano line to re-emerge. “Sea” is a much more modern-classical melody, gentle, and leads the way to a more robust “Sky”. The album comes as a pressed CD, in a handmade, recycled card sleeve and insert, hand stamped and numbered on the back, and limited to 150 copies.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-style: none;\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"align-left\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://preservedsound.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/59/6097793_orig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"461\" height=\"346\"></td>\n<td class=\"align-right\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://preservedsound.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/59/3643371_orig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"461\" height=\"346\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

Unlike their debut album, <em>I Did That Tomorrow</em>, Rasa and Will wrote the tracks together in the same room at the same time; improvising, exploring, innovating, jamming, tweaking, feeding off each other’s ideas and looking for just the right combination, just the right sound. Sometimes searching for that perfect combination involved hours frantically exploring every instrument available in every combination (“Scramble”). Other times, they were grateful for the happy accidents that improvisation can bring (“Fate”).</p>\n<p><em>I Did That Tomorrow</em> is a collection of pieces about initiation and reaction, travel and stillness, simplicity and mutation. The sound world of piano, percussion and electronics, engineered at Will Larsen’s Recliner Studios in Melbourne, shifts through organic, improvisatory, imperfect patterns, playing with the idea of movement in light, space, and liquid, usually resolving – though not necessarily tonally – for a sense of agreement.</p>\n<p>Read an interview with Tess Said So on <em><a href=\"https://www.icareifyoulisten.com/2016/06/5-questions-rasa-daukas-will-larsen-tess-said/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I Care If You LIsten</a></em>.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-style: none;\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"align-left\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><a href=\"https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/scramble-fate\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://preservedsound.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/4/2116578.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"466\" height=\"350\"></a></td>\n<td class=\"align-right\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><a href=\"https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/i-did-that-tomorrow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://preservedsound.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/4/2591697_orig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"466\" height=\"349\"></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Tess Said So</strong> is unique. The repertoire for piano and percussion is all but non-existent, but rather than see that as a limitation, Tess Said So thrives. Built on a longstanding friendship, the duo of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.tesssaidso.com/#!rasa-daukus/ckp9\"><strong>Rasa Daukus</strong></a> (piano, electronics) and <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.tesssaidso.com/#!will-larsen/c8mu\"><strong>Will Larsen</strong></a> (drums, percussion) wanted to take up the challenge, knowing the possibilities were endless and unexplored. Their music is not a jazz/pop trio missing a bass player; their music is of its own, individual and in defiance of conformity, genre, format and convention.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4c122vZqyr4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>",

With contributions from Jim Ghedi , Sharron Krauss and Nick Jonah Davis , <em>Folk Songs for Double Bass</em> transposes traditional folk melodies onto the double bass and created soundscapes around them, building different worlds for them to live in.</p>\n<p>Featuring string quartet, brass, flutes, piano, harmonium, electric guitar, dulcimer, banjo, lap steel, singing saw, two drummers and other bits and pieces, the undercurrent mood of the album was created by drones that crop up throughout the album, with each track shifting in different tangents. “I wanted each song to have its own character, but to capture a similar mood running through the whole album,” says Neal.​</p>\n<p>Neal plays upright and electric bass for Jim Ghedi, Sharron Kraus and Big Eyes Family Players. A double bass maker and repairer by trade, Neal studies at the Newark School of Violin Making, and briefly with master luthiers in France and England. In 2016, he <a href=\"http://hepplestondoublebasses.com/welcome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set up his workshop</a> in central Sheffield, before relocating in 2019 to Mirfield in West Yorkshire.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-style: none;\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"align-left\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><a href=\"https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/folk-songs-for-double-bass\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://preservedsound.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/10/nh-2_1_orig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"466\" height=\"349\"></a></td>\n<td class=\"align-right\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><a href=\"https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/folk-songs-for-double-bass\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://preservedsound.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/10/nh-5_orig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"466\" height=\"349\"></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

Lavoie’s <em><a href=\"https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/88\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">88</a></em> was composed on the piano with bowed and plucked upright basses, some discrete percussion and sound effects.</p>\n<p>“Everything started on the piano,” says Lavoie. “I also explored recording techniques emphasising the sound resulting from the mechanics of the piano and my fingers on the keyboard. These sounds are rarely acoustically audible, but add an intimate and intriguing aspect to the recording.”</p>\n<p>“​I also thought about hiring string players to play on some of the tracks,” says Lavoie. “But eventually decided to take on the challenge of playing everything on the upright bass, to achieve a darker and perhaps more unusual string section.”</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/88\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">88</a></em> is Cédric D. Lavoie’s first album for Preserved Sound. The album comes as a limited edition, hand-assembled CD, download and unlimited stream.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-style: none;\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"align-left\"><a href=\"https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/88\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://preservedsound.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/28/img-6658_orig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\"></a></td>\n<td class=\"align-right\"><a href=\"https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/88\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://preservedsound.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/28/img-6654_orig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\"></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
